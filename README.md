# Image-Segmentation

This project focuses on Image Segmentation, which involves labeling each pixel of an image to identify objects, their shapes, and their positions. The goal is to train a neural network to return a pixel-wise mask of the image.

**Applications**:

* Medical science: Assisting in the analysis of medical images.

* Self-driven cars: Improving the accuracy of object detection.

* Satellite imaging: Enhancing the interpretation of satellite images.

Image Segmentation studies the image at the lowest level to achieve precise results.
